For the inspiration of the imaging technology, I chose Xiao Mi SU7 from GameMCU, especially about those scenes simulating racing cars with radar scanning, which I think is very inspiring for my task, because he shows how the sense of speed of the racing cars and the radar's working process can be shown through the light and shadow, and I would like to borrow this kind of light and shadow effect to use in my project.



Here are some high quality screenshots

For coding and technical exploration, I would consider using libraries such as WebGL, Three.js to achieve the desired effects. With WebGl's GLSL shader program, it's easy to create a variety of rendering methods, including lighting, texture mapping and colour effects. It is also possible to create all kinds of interactions, create all kinds of 3d models through Three.js, and everything else to achieve the effect we want to simulate the environment.



Here's a link to an example showing how to achieve a Xiao Mi SU7-like lighting effect with three.js and WebGl [three.js example (threejs.org)](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgpu_lights_selective)
